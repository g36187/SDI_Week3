    <h2>Project 3</h2>

<article>
<p>This project was meant to be a prequel to the previous two projects. 
   There isn't much in the way of choose your own adventure as it is back story 
   and data mining.  Sadly, the project was not complete as my comprehension was 
   not nearly what I thought it was, and I was overwhelmed with the tasks.</p>
